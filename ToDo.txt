Try to focus on stunning enemies, with direct attacks being weak. Player should be very vunerable while charging strong magic attacks, should
need to stun enemies to be able to pull off with out damage.







Consider:
finegrained interpolation thresholding (only checking subset of properties and/or only affecting subset of properties)
(e.g. platforms moving up or down only have changing displacement, cheaper to just check/change that?)
(and many things don't rescale ever or frequently)
IInterpolated constructor should be passed initial threshold values, which it calls SetThreshold with
(avoids needing to call SetThreshold right after constructing the IInterpolated)
only store value of useThreshold in Interpolator and thresholds in IInterpolated; at most, leave Interpolators with convenience accessors

Ability to look around somewhat while locked on.
Change lock poles, "innacurate" part of projection, to avoid objects we want to lock on.
